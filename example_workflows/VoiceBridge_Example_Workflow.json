this\n\n13\n00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,519\nOne is using the web version on a computer\n\n14\n00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,280\nLet me show you how to use the desktop version first\n\n15\n00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,840\nFirst, copy the link in my bio and open it in your web browser\n\n16\n00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,280\nThen register\n\n17\n00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,359\nThen enter this interface\n\n18\n00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,079\nEnter your prompt here\n\n19\n00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:48,560\nwhich is the content you want to generate\n\n20\n00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,719\nThen just click Run\n\n21\n00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,479\nThe second method is to use the web version directly on your phone\n\n22\n00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,280\nCopy the link in my bio\n\n23\n00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,320\nand open it in your phone's browser\n\n24\n00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,359\nYou can see this interface\n\n25\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,439\nEnter your phone number to register\n\n26\n00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,959\nAfter registering, you'll see this interface\n\n27\n00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,640\nThen scroll down\n\n28\n00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,799\nEnter your prompt here\n\n29\n00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,680\nThen click Run after entering your prompt\n\n30\n00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,120\nNow, let me introduce the workflow behind this tool\n\n31\n00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,879\nThis workflow uses Z Image Base and Z Image Turbo dual sampling\n\n32\n00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,040\nFinally, it uses Flux Client for super-resolution and detail enhancement\n\n33\n00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,239\nFirst, let's look at the tattoo image part\n\n34\n00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,840\nIn the first stage of sampling, we use the Z Image Base model\n\n35\n00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,560\nAs we all know, the Base model allows for 'card drawing'\n\n36\n00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,920\nThis means when we change the random seed\n\n37\n00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920\nthe resulting images will be very different\n\n38\n00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,079\nUnlike the Turbo model, it won't result in homogenization\n\n39\n00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,239\nI did an experiment here\n\n40\n00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,920\nYou can take a look\n\n41\n00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,200\nThe top one is generated by the Base model\n\n42\n00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:09,599\nThe bottom one is generated by the Turbo model\n\n43\n00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,000\nThe difference between these two images is that they use different random seeds\n\n44\n00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,759\nBut with the same prompt\n\n45\n00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:24,400\nAs you can see, when the Base model generates two images with different random seeds\n\n46\n00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,560\nthe overall structure and color tone change significantly\n\n47\n00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,719\nWhereas the Turbo model is exactly the opposite\n\n48\n00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,360\nBecause the Turbo model is an acceleration model\n\n49\n00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,879\nIt leads to images that look the same, even if different random seeds are used\n\n50\n00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,199\nresulting in homogenization\n\n51\n00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,000\nThis applies to portraits as well\n\n52\n00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,080\nSo for the first stage of sampling, we use the Base model here\n\n53\n00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,719\nto increase the diversity of the output\n\n54\n00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000\nHowever, the Base model has a downside\n\n55\n00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,960\nBecause it requires a high number of sampling steps\n\n56\n00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,639\nIt needs 30 to 50 steps\n\n57\n00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,039\nThis makes the image generation speed relatively slow\n\n58\n00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:06,292\nSo in the subsequent sampling\n\n59\n00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:07,651\nwe use the Turbo model\n\n60\n00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:12,372\nBecause the Turbo model's feature is that it can accelerate\n\n61\n00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,692\nIn the AI generation process\n\n62\n00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,812\nthe first half of the sampling generates the rough outline of the image\n\n63\n00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:20,771\nwhich is blurry\n\n64\n00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:22,051\nAs you can see\n\n65\n00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:22,611\nthe result of the first half of sampling looks like this\n\n66\n00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:27,891\nwhile the second half actually enriches the details\n\n67\n00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:29,092\nincluding the denoising process\n\n68\n00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:32,372\nYou can see the second half slowly enriches the details\n\n69\n00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:39,412\nSo the first few steps of sampling actually determine the rough composition and outline of the image\n\n70\n00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,092\nUsing the diversity of our Base model at this stage\n\n71\n00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,931\nallows our final images to achieve a 'card-drawing' effect\n\n72\n00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:50,852\nmeaning our final images are more diverse\n\n73\n00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:54,372\nFinally, let's look at the super-resolution part\n\n74\n00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:59,252\nThis uses a Flux Client workflow\n\n75\n00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:00,532\nIt's an image-to-image workflow\n\n76\n00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,572\nAs you can see, the prompt is quite simple\n\n77\n00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,132\nLet's look at the comparison results before and after super-resolution\n\n78\n00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,292\nThis is after super-resolution\n\n79\n00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,331\nThis is before super-resolution\n\n80\n00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,812\nYou can see that it's not just simple super-resolution\n\n81\n00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:20,932\nbut also adds various details to the character's face\n\n82\n00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:21,732\nI think this is one of the most amazing features of Flux Client\n\n83\n00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:28,132\nThe final images look very realistic too"]},{"id":43,"type":"PrimitiveStringMultiline","pos":[4940.634129458339,1942.5612207900604],"size":[336.04651162790833,523.8372093023249],"flags":{},"order":4,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"值","name":"value","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"value"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"字符串","name":"STRING","type":"STRING","links":[]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.12.1","Node

the Base model here\n\n53\n00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,719\nto increase the diversity of the output\n\n54\n00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,000\nHowever, the Base model has a downside\n\n55\n00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,960\nBecause it requires a high number of sampling steps\n\n56\n00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,639\nIt needs 30 to 50 steps\n\n57\n00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,039\nThis makes the image generation speed relatively slow\n\n58\n00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:06,292\nSo in the subsequent sampling\n\n59\n00:03:06,292 --> 00:03:07,651\nwe use the Turbo model\n\n60\n00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:12,372\nBecause the Turbo model's feature is that it can accelerate\n\n61\n00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:16,692\nIn the AI generation process\n\n62\n00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:19,812\nthe first half of the sampling generates the rough outline of the image\n\n63\n00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:20,771\nwhich is blurry\n\n64\n00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:22,051\nAs you can see\n\n65\n00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:22,611\nthe result of the first half of sampling looks like this\n\n66\n00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:27,891\nwhile the second half actually enriches the details\n\n67\n00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:29,092\nincluding the denoising process\n\n68\n00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:32,372\nYou can see the second half slowly enriches the details\n\n69\n00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:39,412\nSo the first few steps of sampling actually determine the rough composition and outline of the image\n\n70\n00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:43,092\nUsing the diversity of our Base model at this stage\n\n71\n00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,931\nallows our final images to achieve a 'card-drawing' effect\n\n72\n00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:50,852\nmeaning our final images are more diverse\n\n73\n00:03:54,132 --> 00:03:54,372\nFinally, let's look at the super-resolution part\n\n74\n00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:59,252\nThis uses a Flux Client workflow\n\n75\n00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:00,532\nIt's an image-to-image workflow\n\n76\n00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,572\nAs you can see, the prompt is quite simple\n\n77\n00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,132\nLet's look at the comparison results before and after super-resolution\n\n78\n00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:10,292\nThis is after super-resolution\n\n79\n00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,331\nThis is before super-resolution\n\n80\n00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,812\nYou can see that it's not just simple super-resolution\n\n81\n00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:20,932\nbut also adds various details to the character's face\n\n82\n00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:21,732\nI think this is one of the most amazing features of Flux Client\n\n83\n00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:28,132\nThe final images look very realistic too"]},{"id":29,"type":"SaveSRTFromString","pos":[4204.6165923381195,1220.91782601275],"size":[270,82],"flags":{},"order":17,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"srt_string","name":"srt_string","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"srt_string"},"link":46},{"localized_name":"file_name","name":"file_name","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"file_name"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"save_path","name":"save_path","type":"STRING","links":[47]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfyui_voicebridge","ver":"unknown","Node
